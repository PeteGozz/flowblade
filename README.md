** Not Really [Flowblade](https://github.com/jliljebl/flowblade) **

-------------------------------
Warning Experimental Repository
-------------------------------

    This *fork* is really a *study* of GObject and Python.
    If I happen to make it work more readily on smaller screens
    (say 1024 X 760 )
    well fine, but *don't hold your breath*.

It already does just that BUT *crudely*.

Right click resize, should , enable you at least to
drag the main window around. 

*At least you can assess this excellent stable app.*
Which has an interface design aimed at more modern screen resolutions.
(Then go and use the real one )

    Hint: -
    - I can use it like this so maybe you can :)
    - configure preferences for two windows.
    - set up defaults with few video and SFX tracks.
    
    Hint: you can run this from unpacked sources without installing.
